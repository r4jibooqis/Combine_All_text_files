# Combine Text Files into Corpus

## Overview
This project provides a simple Python script to combine multiple text files into a single corpus file. The corpus file can be useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text analysis, machine learning, or data preprocessing.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone the Repository:
  'git clone https://github.com/your-username/combine-text-files.git'
1. Edit the code:
  'Add folder path that contain text files'
  'Add output text file path (corpus)'
1. Run the Script:
  'python3 GenerateCorpus.py'
  
The combined corpus will be generated as corpus.txt in the output directory.

## Acknowledgments
